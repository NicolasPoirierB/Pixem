# Pixem
Pixels and EMs, easy-peasy.

## What does it do?
Pixem gives you a preview of pretty basic and common used font-sizes in **em** units based on a font-size you previously determined. It's simple, and works to give you a good feeling on what ratio to choose at a glance!

## Why?
'Cause dem devs be lazy.

## Speaking of lazy, what do *I* need to do?
Enter a base font-size! **That's it**.

Or not. (Seriously, there's a default).
